You must install the following packages to use Gyrc (if any are not already installed):

python3
python3-pygobject OR python3-gi (depending on your distribution)
python3-requests
python3-pip
git

The library which powers Gyrc is pymusiccast, to install it:

pip3 install pymusiccast

Then, in the folder you wish to install to:

git clone https://github.com/balinbob/yrc

This will make the yrc (yamaha receiver control) folder.   From it, run:
./gyrc

or:
ln -s PATH_TO_YRC_FOLDER/gyrc ~/.local/bin/gyrc

and make sure ~/.local/bin is in your executable PATH.



To find the ip address of your receiver, you can search for it on the lan, or
use the receiver's on-screen-display.
